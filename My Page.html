              Link is the main protagonist of the Legend of Zelda series.
              He is the everlasting hero of the setting, having appeared
              throughout the ages in a neverending line of incarnations.
              The various heroes who use the name Link are courageous young
              boys or teenagers in green clothing who leave their homes
              to save the world from evil forces threatening it.

                Princess Zelda, is the eponymous name commonly given to the
                women born into the Royal Family of Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda
                series With the exception of Link's Awakening, Majora's Mask, and
                Tri Force Heroes, an incarnation of Zelda or one of her alter egos
                has always been one of the central characters in the series. Each
                incarnation of Zelda has been shown at various ages depending on
                which title they appear in. They have appeared as a child, a teenager
                and as a young adult; for example, the Princess Zelda in Twilight Princess
                is around 20 years of age.

                <blockquote>
                Introduced in The Legend of Zelda as a monstrous Prince of Darkness,
                Ganon's character has seen much development throughout the series,
                from being a simple monster to a powerful warlock with deeper motives
                to his actions. As the manifestation of the Demon King Demise's
                hatred for the Goddess and her Chosen Hero
                (or, according to the Hyrule Historia, the reincarnation of Demise himself),
                Ganon is destined to eternally reincarnate to pursue world domination.
                In most cases though, he makes a return after being resurrected or breaking a seal.
                Four Swords Adventures is a notable exception, featuring a reincarnated Ganondorf.
                The original Ganondorf from Ocarina of Time appears in the rest of the games,
                making him stand out from other villains as the same character from game-to-game.
